    "text": "Hi there, I’m Ananya. I’m passionate about analyzing data for social good and making knowledge from research more accessible. I’ve always enjoyed stories from a young age and I believe that data can tell really meaningful ones. I recently got my Bachelor’s in Psychology, and I decided to switch fields a bit because I wanted to understand the research process better and learn more about big data analysis. In past internships, I’ve collected and analyzed survey data related to the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 and how a social media app can improve relationship quality. I was involved in a lot of teamwork since big surveys are a team effort and I’ve also interacted with several people while administering the surveys. Through these experiences, I realized that research needs to be inclusive and representative - and that’s what I want to work towards. Along the way I’ve also learnt programming languages like R, Python, Java, and SQL. I’m currently a graduate student at the Data Analytics and Computational Social Science program at UMass Amherst - where I’m able to combine all of my interests."
